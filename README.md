Chapter 19: Spring Rest Template

This project acts as a client to the spring-6-rest-mvc which runs on port 8080.
Required other modules up and running:
- authentication server on port 9000
- mvc module running on port 8080

TODOS:
- TODO: PROBABLY WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS MODULE RUNNING ON ANOTHER PORT AS 8080. CONFLICTS WITH THE SERVER MVC PART.
- THE INTEGRATION TESTS ARE CURRENTLY DISABLED BECAUSE THE TESTS ARE ONLY SUCCESSFULL WE THE TWO SERVER SECTIONS (MVC, AUTHENTICATION) ARE UP AND RUNNING. PROBABLY A MULTI MODULE SETUP CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM, WHICH STARTS THE OTHER MODULES.

This repository is for an example application built in my [Spring Framework 6 - Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-6-beginner-to-guru/?referralCode=2BD0B7B7B6B511D699A9) online course

The application is a simple Spring Boot 3 / Spring Framework 6 web application. It is used to help students learn how
to use the Spring Framework. Step by step instructions and detailed explanations can be found within the course.
